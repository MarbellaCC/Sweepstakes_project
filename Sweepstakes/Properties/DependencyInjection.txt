Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is happening in the MarketingFirm class. The type of manager that runs the sweepstakes can be Queue 
or Stack. The benefit of this is the MarketingFirm class doesnt depend on a single class. It now depends on the interface,
ISweepstakesManager, making it more flexible.
